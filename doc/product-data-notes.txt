Q: should we be tracking per-site product URLs?  This was done in the past, but is there any need / advantage to doing this in this architecture?
Q: what is "quantity required" from the "Database Inventory" sheet of the requirements specification?


Strategy:

 order of creation/import:  organization, sites, facility product, price, inventory

 - take yahoo xml export (or google base export) to generate initial product list
 - use the FoT stock list to begin populating Facilities (warehouses) and Inventory quantities for products
 - get an extract or list from Tally (?) to begin populating more products, facilities, and inventory quantities
 - is there additional information in the "Tilonia Wholesale Price List" spreadsheet?
 - we can pull image links from the spreadsheet just called "tilonia.xls" as well as basic product_type
